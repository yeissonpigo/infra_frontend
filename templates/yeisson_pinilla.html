        <h1>Why should I care about dockers?</h1>
        <p>Before starting with the actual topic for this essay, it is required to explain briefly what “Docker” is, what it does, and why it is important to be used on software development nowadays. Docker is an English word, which is related with those huge ships carrying huge containers, but in this case, we are talking about the open platform that is used for software development. What does docker do? Easy, it basically creates an extra layer on your machine, where you can install any requirement, dependency, library, etc, that needs to be used by your software project. Why is it important? Well, some years ago before docker existed, software engineers were facing a huge problem: the project could work perfectly fine in someone’s computer, but then someone other’s computer would face dependency problems, maybe some library wasn’t installed correctly, maybe some environment variables had different names or values, giving everybody on the development team a major headache, and this is what docker is solving: creates an extra layer con the developer’s computer, where they can install all the dependencies, requirement, configure variables, and so on, then, they just need to share the “docker image” (which is nothing but a docker file containing all the info of the extra layer), to the rest of the team, and voila, everybody should be able to work on the project without any dependency issue.</p>
        <p>Now, why should we care about dockers at all? Well, right now docker is an open-source project, which means everybody can check the code, and modify according to what they need. Moreover, and maybe even the best part, it’s that is for free. Therefore, we should care that the project doesn’t get sold to a company that wants to privatize it, and start charging us for using docker, it this happens, software development might start getting more and more expensive, meaning that it would be every day less and less affordable for small start ups and companies. </p>
        <p>Let’s give an example of when docker can be used in a real-world project, and why this helps so much: let’s say a client asks certain software company (called A from now), to develop a web platform to manage employees’ payment. The requirements include using Django, postgresql, and numpy with pandas libraries. On the development team there are four members. Three of them are junior developers, who just got this job, being this one their first job. Therefore, you can expect that the juniors require a lot of help with installing dependencies. On the other hand, there’s only one senior developer, which know exactly what to do and when to do it. The senior developer is the one in charge to create the project, uploading it to github, and then giving access and assigning tasks to the junior developers to start developing the project. However, they don’t know which libraries the senior used when created the project, and now they are facing tons of errors and they don’t have any idea where to start. The senior can identify easily what’s wrong and tells the juniors how to solve it. On the whole process, about one day was lost trying to fix such a simple error. How could it have been avoided? I hope you get the point: docker. If the team would’ve used docker from the first time, they wouldn’t have had to worry about installing dependencies, and no time would’ve been lost on the process.</p>
        <p>Finally, the whole purpose of this essay is to bring awareness about how important docker is in a software development project, such a simple idea (complicated to develop, though), was able to simplify the development of software thanks to this new extra layer that is created on the SO of any computer. Making it compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux, which are the most famous SO nowadays, and the most used for software development. However, it’s also attempted to point at the fact that no one should allow docker getting privatize since the price could be extremely high due to the importance of this in any software development project. In conclusion, Docker is one of the most used open-source platforms nowadays due to its importance on software development, and how much it makes everything easier. On the same way, every single software developer should learn to use it and apply it on any project. Some frameworks are already making it some way required, for example, latest releases of Django explain how to set up a Django project using docker rather than without using it. This is nothing more but one of the many cases of different technologies thar are adapting to the use of docker due to what it can do and how helpful it can be for any company. </p>
